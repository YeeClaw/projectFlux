# **YeeClaw's Kitchen** #
-------------------------

*this pack is still in **very** early development*

## At a Glance ##

YeeClaw's Kitchen is a kitchen sink mod pack for Minecraft 1.12.2 built around realistic progression and multiplayer conflict. Countless changes to recipes allow for the dynamics of the (almost) 300 different mods to flow seamlessly, while an in-depth questing system keeps you pushing forward in the most realistic way available. If you would like a full mod list, one can be found in the `modlist.md` file.

## Designed for Multiplayer ##

YeeClaw's Kitchen has been built from the ground up to support not-so-friendly multiplayer progression with your friends! With the inclusions of MineColonies, Open Modular Turrets, WarpDrive, ICBM Classic, and much more, you are encouraged to have some conflicts with other people. However, this doesn't mean that it is a *requirement* to play multiplayer. The pack is still super enjoyable and playable by yourself!

## Exploration ##

While this pack isn't big on adding new dimensions, it adds exploration in more subtle places where it counts. Cave generation has been completely overhauled with WorleyCaves, while Advanced Rocketry and WarpDrive brings the exciting final frontier left to be explored. Ore generation has also been completely changed. Gone are the days where you would walk through caves and see dozens of different small veins to collect from all sorts of mods. In YeeClaw's Kitchen, ore deposits are fairly large, and fairly rare. This makes the process of mining much more relevant and rewarding. This mod pack also uses Biomes O' Plenty for its world generation which means that there are now 80 new and unique biomes to explore.

## Technology and Magic Combined ##

Most kitchen sink packs are designed to have magic and technology progress separately and on their own respective branches. However, this is not the case with YeeClaw's Kitchen. This pack has been designed in both its recipes and and questing to use magic and technology together and as one. This ensures that both different aspects of the pack progress evenly and with each other. Gone are the days when magic is only early/mid game.

## Progression and Survival ##

YeeClaw's Kitchen is meant to progress through magic and technology in the most realistic, chronological way possible. This means that as you start out in the pack, you will only have primitive technology, magic, and defense measures from other players and the environment. However, as you go on, the technology that you have gets more and more advanced as you push through time.

As far as survival goes, it has been kept relatively simple yet balanced through progression. Nothing has been changed with hunger and temperature, as I felt it was too taxing on players to keep those things in check. Lighting and mobs on the other hand, have been changed a lot. With the inclusion of Epic Seige, Mowzie's Mobs, and Hardcore Darkness (night lighting has been configured to only be dependant on the moon cycle), you have to be sure to be on your A game throughout the play through.

## Pack Difficulty ##

YeeClaw's Kitchen serves to be a nice in-between from expert styled packs and normal difficulty packs. This means that the pack wont be excessively "grindy", while also retaining the complexion and longevity of a proper mod pack. If you are a beginner to the modded minecraft scene, it is highly recommended that you go to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCaAxV-tXOnvVderrCtviGw?">official</a> YouTube channel to get you started on the basics of the core progression mods.
